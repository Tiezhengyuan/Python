    "\n",
    "Moreover, the calculator needs a change sign function, a decimal point button and the clear button. We don't have to mention that your calculator should be resistant to zero-division attempts, in which case it should display an error message instead of producing any garbage result or raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screenshots we present below are just a suggestion. You can design the UI in a different way, and it will be good as long as your calculator works properly. We aren't able to collect all strict requirements in one place - we can only say that each time you have doubts about how to implement a particular behavior, you should just pick up a real pocket calculator and check how it works in the specific context.\n",

    "you are allowed to remove some less significant digits located after the decimal point to shorten the result in effect,\n",
